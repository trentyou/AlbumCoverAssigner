AlbumCoverAssigner
==================
My ongoing project that seeks to replace my library of MP3s with ID3 tags that are broken or have been poorly assigned. My biggest problems are the album covers, some of which are empty and some of which are not assigned properly. This script will hopefully use a combination of the song name, song artist and album name to search databases such as [rdio] and last.fm to pull metadata about the song and assign them to their proper catagories.
